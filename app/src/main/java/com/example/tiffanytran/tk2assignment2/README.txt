For Assignment 2, our Candy Crush game uses 6 different candies and randomizes it onto a 9x9 grid.  The user can swipe left-right, right-left, top-bottom, or bottom-top to create a 3 or more combination for the same candies.  The candies will then be deleted and the candies at the top will drop down accordingly.  The user wins the game if he/she reaches 2000 points or when there is no more combinations left.  The display will read “Your High Score is:” followed by the user’s points earned.  Also, while playing the game, the user’s score is displayed, starting at 0 points, and it will increment by 10 points per each candy that gets deleted.
